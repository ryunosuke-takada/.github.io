        about_text_1: "Born in 2007. I have had a strong interest in mathematics and music (piano, percussion, composition) since childhood. Currently, I focus on the relationship between the two, pursuing interactive expressions that integrate them, such as composition using numerical algorithms and introducing auditory approaches to mathematics. I also apply my research findings to instrument design, handling everything from design and branding to performance consistently (Top Prize at the Italy International Percussion Competition). Based on my own experiences, I also focus on Gifted Education and STEAM Education in Japan, exploring a diverse and creative educational model that transcends the boundaries of academia and art. My areas of interest range from Physics, Topology, Instrument Design, AI, and Programming to Oil Painting, Design, Haiku, and Rubik's Cubes. My core interest lies in crossing the boundaries of academia, art, and craftsmanship to create new values and forms of expression through the harmony of mathematical thinking and sensibility.",\
